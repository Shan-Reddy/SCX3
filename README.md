<strong>Target Course: CYB 4900-Cybersecurity Capstone Project</strong><br><br>
<strong>Course Objective:</strong><br> 

In the CYB 4900 Cybersecurity Capstone Project, student integrates deep learning with cybersecurity threat intelligence to address the specific challenges posed by Internet-of-Vehicles, particularly in the context of emergency vehicles using synthetic cyber knowledge graphs to represent and analyze cyber threat intelligence and relationships, and they will employ deep learning algorithms such as Autoencoders, RNNs, and CNNs for anomaly detection within this graph data. <br>

<strong>Course Competency statement:</strong><br>
The students in the course will become competent to complete the following “task” in the context of the “Threat/Warning Analyst” work role defined in the NICE Workforce
Framework.<br>
NICE Framework Task:<br>
- T0748 - Monitor and report changes in threat dispositions, activities, tactics, capabilities, objectives, etc. as related to designated cyber operations warning problem sets.

<strong>Course Goals/Tasks/Assignments:</strong><br>
- Build SCKGs with Frontends.
- Create STIX objects and store them.
- Generate interconnected threat graphs and visualization.
- Implement deep learning algorithms.
- Preprocess and format data.
